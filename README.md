# CraterCrawlers
Video game set in a crater with aliens, guns, fire and a farmer.

# Story
While trying to enjoy a peaceful vacation to planet Earth, an alien civilization crash lands directly on top of a Farmers land, trapping him inside the immense crater formed upon impact. Blaming the humans for ruining their vacation, the aliens attack. Faced with no other choice, the farmer must defend his land and planet Earth from the oncoming swarms of aliens vacationers. Take on level upon level of relentless alien forces and defend your planet. How long can you survive in Crater Crawlers?

# The Making
This game was made in the free version of Unity as an attempt to broaden my horizons, and also to produce something that could potentially be sort of fun. Although this game is still under development, I couldn't wait to put it on GitHub. I could not have pulled it off without the creative help of my girlfriend and the programming help of my classmates at ISU. Another big thanks to Unity for supplying me with the tools to put this game into action. 

Although there may not be a good way to post code and pictures on GitHub, I have this game documented on my professional website at:

Feel free to check it out along with any other projects I have posted on there. If you are interested in playing the game or finding out more about my other projects, shoot me an email.
